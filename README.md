# cumulocity-client-reactive-spring-boot
Cumulocity client using spring boot reactive stack (WebFlux)

## State

Current Cumulocity Java SDK are synchrone. To build a non blocking and even a reactive application a reactive client is needed. Currently i do first steps using WebFlux and did first draft of InventoryService. I am looking also for contributors, please let me know! 

## Vision

- Reflecting complete Cumulocity API as java reactive client, aligned to @c8y/client (http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/client/)
- Reflecting complete Cumulocity API as kotlin reactive client, aligned to @c8y/client (http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/client/)
- Easy integration in spring boot application as starter
- Java/Kotlin client should be isomorphic (can be used for microservice and agent)
